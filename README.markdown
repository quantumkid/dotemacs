My .emacs file
==============

This is my personal `.emacs` file, which configures GNU emacs on startup.


Installation
------------

To install, put `emacs.el` somewhere on your computer (the standard
directory is `~/.emacs.d`). Then open your current `~/.emacs` file, and
place the following somewhere near the top:

    (load "<install path>/emacs.el")
    
    
I don't guarantee that this file will work straight away, as it has
several dependencies.
